Hi, I'm Laurent Marshall. I'm a former U.S. Peace Corps volunteer (Ukraine, 2010-2013) currently working at an [IT company](https://dtm.io) in customer relations and marketing. I initially created this blog as a way to experiment with [Docker](www.docker.com) and the static site generator/web server [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and just called it "TestBlog" in the config file. It will probably stay that way unless I can think of something better (I have my doubts). 

Over the last year or so I've become more interested in IT, computing, and programming. At the moment I'm doing my best to learn more about Linux systems administration and devops as spare time allows, but I've also dabbled in Python programming and Go(lang). Beyond IT, my interests are wide and varied and you may see some non-IT themed posts from time to time. 

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://ua.linkedin.com/in/LaurentMarshall) or [Github](https://github.com/LEMarshall).
